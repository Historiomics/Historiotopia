# Historiotopia
* In essence, the Historiotopia is the three-dimensional "surface" of a Workspace;
* The Artist inhabits and works in the Workspace, called "The Historiotheque";
* At any given moment in time, the Workspace itself is in a current "configuration" or "state";
* The Artist is continuously, perpetually "archiving" the given "Points-in-Time" or configurations/states of the Historiotheque (Workspace):
* The "Production-Year" in the case of the (AG)-Method begins more or less in the Fall;
* The Production-Year always starts with an official, and public, DECLARATION OF NEW PRODUCTION-YEAR;
* The Declaration itself is the first official document of the new Production-Year;
* The document of the Declaration always contains the (AG) symbol, representing the license of the (AG)-Method, and acts as Signature; (see: Authentication)
* Once again, at any given Point-in-Time, the workspace is in a given three- or even four-dimensional "configuration" that is constantly being "archived";
* We say that the worker engages in "Session Management", with each moment that he/she is actively working being called, considered a single "Session";
* In essence, the artist/worker at any given Point-in-Time ("PiT") only has "access" to "Surfaces"; (See: Point-in-Time, a.k.a. "PiT", a.k.a. "PiT-stop", a.k.a. "Artists-In-Transition Need Art-Stops", to be extrapolated);
* That is to say, the artist is working amidst all of the "exposed surfaces" of the Workspace; (only surfaces are "accessible" at any given moment in time, even something in the Archives, once exposed, is an outward-facing surface)
* The artist essentially takes a "Snapshot" of the current state of the Historiotheque; ("Snapshot" or "Savepoint")
* The Session is "saved", and put into the archive, with proper Documentation; (Documentation to be treated in its own section)
* The HISTORIOTOPIA, then, is the three-dimensional configuration of the Workspace (Historiotheque) at any given moment in time;
* The HISTORIOTOPIA is composed of all the outward-facing, exposed, SURFACES of the Workspace;
* The HISTORIOTOPIA is what is effectively being Archived at any given time in the Session Management process;
* After the DECLARATION OF NEW PRODUCTION-YEAR, the worker in the Art Operation or "ArtOps" begins with an Introduction To The Historiotheque, an introduction to the workspace;
* This is important because the Declaration already gave forward-looking statements about the new Production-Year, for investors and other interested parties, so that they can have a "taste" or "preview" of what to expect to come out of the Laboratory in the period covered in the Declaration (Historiotheques are Laboratories, to be explained in its own section);
