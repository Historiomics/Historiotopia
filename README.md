# Historiotopia
* In essence, the Historiotopia is the three-dimensional "surface" of a Workspace;
* The Artist inhabits and works in the Workspace, called "The Historiotheque";
* At any given moment in time, the Workspace itself is in a current "configuration" or "state";
* The Artist is continuously, perpetually "archiving" the given "Points-in-Time" or configurations/states of the Historiotheque (Workspace):
* The "Production-Year" in the case of the (AG)-Method begins more or less in the Fall;
* The Production-Year always starts with an official, and public, DECLARATION OF NEW PRODUCTION-YEAR;
* The Declaration itself is the first official document of the new Production-Year;
* The document of the Declaration always contains the (AG) symbol, representing the license of the (AG)-Method, and acts as Signature; (see: Authentication)
* Once again, at any given Point-in-Time, the workspace is in a given three- or even four-dimensional "configuration" that is constantly being "archived";
* We say that the worker engages in "Session Management", with each moment that he/she is actively working being called, considered a single "Session";
* In essence, the artist/worker at any given Point-in-Time ("PiT") only has "access" to "Surfaces"; (See: Point-in-Time, a.k.a. "PiT", a.k.a. "PiT-stop", a.k.a. "Artists-In-Transition Need Art-Stops", to be extrapolated);
* That is to say, the artist is working amidst all of the "exposed surfaces" of the Workspace; (only surfaces are "accessible" at any given moment in time, even something in the Archives, once exposed, is an outward-facing surface)
* The artist essentially takes a "Snapshot" of the current state of the Historiotheque; ("Snapshot" or "Savepoint")
* The Session is "saved", and put into the archive, with proper Documentation; (Documentation to be treated in its own section)
* The HISTORIOTOPIA, then, is the three-dimensional configuration of the Workspace (Historiotheque) at any given moment in time;
* The HISTORIOTOPIA is composed of all the outward-facing, exposed, SURFACES of the Workspace;
* The HISTORIOTOPIA is what is effectively being Archived at any given time in the Session Management process;
* After the DECLARATION OF NEW PRODUCTION-YEAR, the worker in the Art Operation or "ArtOps" begins with an Introduction To The Historiotheque, an introduction to the workspace;
* This is important because the Declaration already gave forward-looking statements about the new Production-Year, for investors and other interested parties, so that they can have a "taste" or "preview" of what to expect to come out of the Laboratory in the period covered in the Declaration (Historiotheques are Laboratories, to be explained in its own section);
* In the Introduction to the Workspace, a "taking-stock-of" operation/process is necessary, a taking-stock if you will of "Inventory" (also a public declaration), which is essentially repeated at the beginning of any given "Session" (not necessarily publicly declared in those instances);
* Now the worker can more or less start working. To give you an example, I just did my annual Declaration and the first actual Painting I will be publishing is called an "Archive-Painting", part of the Archives-Project. Essentially it will be a "Snapshot" ("Savepoint") of the current "State of Affairs" of the Workshop called The Historiotheque. Consider it a "picture" of the Archives, to get us started on new Projects and Operations;
* In the Historiotheque, the Art Operator works on "Projects", which are ongoing Series" and therefore growing "Collections" of works, pertaining to given Projects, which always have their clusters of new Concepts the artist is working on;
* The work is very complex and is one of the main reasons such "formalities" are needed, of the official public "DECLARATION" and so forth;
* That is to say, we are talking about a serious, mature Art Practise, hereby called an "Art Operation" or "ArtOps";
* That is to say, the Art Operation is a serious professional practise, and a legal entity in its own right;
* WARNING: No one should take any of this as "counsel" or "advice" on launching art practises or business operations. This is not meant to motivate or inspire anyone to venture into some commercial endeavor or venture, for Business with a capital B is ALWAYS RISKY. I cannot be held responsible for anyone's RISK-TAKING BEHAVIORS. This is merely a document explaining, describing, MY method, the (AG)-Method; (Further warnings to be included and made evident)
* So far, this is merely a Github repository with Text; later, Images will be included, and possibly Sounds;
* That is to say, this public Github repository and the textual data it contains is not a "business transaction"; it is merely explanatory textual data on the Historiomic Theory of Art Operations and consequently of THE HISTORIOTOPIA;
