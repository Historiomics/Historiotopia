# Historiotopia
* In essence, the Historiotopia is the three-dimensional "surface" of a Workspace;
* The Artist inhabits and works in the Workspace, called "The Historiotheque";
* At any given moment in time, the Workspace itself is in a current "configuration" or "state";
* The Artist is continuously, perpetually "archiving" the given "Points-in-Time" or configurations/states of the Historiotheque (Workspace):
* The "Production-Year" in the case of the (AG)-Method begins more or less in the Fall;
* The Production-Year always starts with an official, and public, DECLARATION OF NEW PRODUCTION-YEAR;
* The Declaration itself is the first official document of the new Production-Year;
* The document of the Declaration always contains the (AG) symbol, representing the license of the (AG)-Method, and acts as Signature; (see: Authentication)
*
